# Inventory Management System Documentation
Overview
The Inventory Management System is a program developed as a project for CSC 392. It is designed to help users manage a product inventory, and it is particularly relevant to the place where I completed my SIWES (Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme). The program is similar to an inventory management system used by my SIWES company to track computer systems, printers, routers, and other assets.
